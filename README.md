# Sales Data Analysis with Python

This project involves the analysis of sales data to derive meaningful insights and trends. The code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, Seaborn, NumPy, and Pandas for data processing and visualization.

## Project Overview

The project primarily focuses on the following aspects:
- Unzipping and preprocessing sales data from a provided dataset
- Analyzing monthly and city-wise sales patterns
- Exploring product category-wise sales insights
- Visualizing monthly sales trends using time series analysis and a 3-month moving average

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
- Dropping irrelevant columns
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering to extract useful information from the data

## Key Visualizations

Several key visualizations are generated for the provided sales data, including:
- Monthly sales analysis through bar plots
- City-wise sales analysis using bar plots
- Product category-wise sales analysis through bar plots
- Time series analysis to observe monthly sales trends
- 3-month moving average visualization for smoother trends

## Usage

The code provided can be utilized to perform similar analysis tasks on sales data. Users can modify the code to analyze their own datasets and gain valuable insights into their sales patterns.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code:
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
